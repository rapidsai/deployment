# HPC

RAPIDS works extremely well in traditional HPC environments where GPUs are often co-located with accelerated networking hardware such as InfiniBand. Deploying on HPC often means using queue management systems such as SLURM, LSF, PBS, etc.

## SLURM

Installation instructions for SLURM are hosted at the [RAPIDS HPC page](https://rapids.ai/hpc).
