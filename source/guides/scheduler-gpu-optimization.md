# GPU optimization for the Dask scheduler on Kubernetes

An optimization users can make while deploying Dask clusters is to ensure that the scheduler is placed on a node with a less powerful GPU to reduce overall cost. [This previous guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/deployment/stable/guides/scheduler-gpu-requirements/) explains why the scheduler needs access to the same environment as the workers, as there are a few edge cases where the scheduler does serialize data and unpickles high-level graphs.

```{warning}
This guide outlines our current advice on scheduler hardware requirements, but this may be subject to change.
```

However, when working with nodes with multiple GPUs, placing the scheduler on one of these nodes would be a waste of resources. This guide walks through the steps to create a Kubernetes cluster on GKE along with a nodepool of less powerful Nvidia Tesla T4 GPUs and placing the scheduler on this node using Kubernetes node affinity.

## Prerequisites

First you'll need to have the [`gcloud` CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) installed along with [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), [`helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), etc for managing Kubernetes.

Ensure you are logged into the `gcloud` CLI.

```console
$ gcloud init
```

## Create the Kubernetes cluster

Now we can launch a GPU enabled GKE cluster.

```console
$ gcloud container clusters create rapids-gpu \
  --accelerator type=nvidia-tesla-a100,count=2 --machine-type a2-highgpu-2g \
  --zone us-central1-c --release-channel stable
```

With this command, you’ve launched a GKE cluster called `rapids-gpu`. You’ve specified that it should use nodes of type
a2-highgpu-2g, each with two A100 GPUs.

## Create the dedicated nodepool for the scheduler

Now create a new nodepool on this GPU cluster.

```console
$ gcloud container node-pools create scheduler-pool --cluster rapids-gpu \
  --accelerator type=nvidia-tesla-t4,count=1 --machine-type n1-standard-2 \
  --num-nodes 1 --node-labels dedicated=scheduler --zone us-central1-c
```

With this command, you've created an additional nodepool called `scheduler-pool` with 1 node. You've also specified that it should use a node of type n1-standard-2, with one T4 GPU.
We also add a Kubernetes label `dedicated=scheduled` to the node in this nodepool which will be used to place the scheduler onto this node.

## Install drivers

Next, [install the NVIDIA drivers](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus#installing_drivers) onto each node.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/container-engine-accelerators/master/nvidia-driver-installer/cos/daemonset-preloaded-latest.yaml
daemonset.apps/nvidia-driver-installer created
```

Verify that the NVIDIA drivers are successfully installed.

```console
$ kubectl get po -A --watch | grep nvidia
kube-system   nvidia-driver-installer-6zwcn                                 1/1     Running   0         8m47s
kube-system   nvidia-driver-installer-8zmmn                                 1/1     Running   0         8m47s
kube-system   nvidia-driver-installer-mjkb8                                 1/1     Running   0         8m47s
kube-system   nvidia-gpu-device-plugin-5ffkm                                1/1     Running   0         13m
kube-system   nvidia-gpu-device-plugin-d599s                                1/1     Running   0         13m
kube-system   nvidia-gpu-device-plugin-jrgjh                                1/1     Running   0         13m
```

After your drivers are installed, you are ready to test your cluster.

```{include} ../_includes/check-gpu-pod-works.md

```

### Installing Dask operator with Helm

The operator has a Helm chart which can be used to manage the installation of the operator. The chart is published in the [Dask Helm Repo](https://helm.dask.org) repository, and can be installed via:

```console
$ helm repo add dask https://helm.dask.org
"dask" has been added to your repositories

$ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "dask" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈

$ helm install --create-namespace -n dask-operator --generate-name dask/dask-kubernetes-operator
NAME: dask-kubernetes-operator-1666875935
NAMESPACE: dask-operator
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Operator has been installed successfully.
```

Then you should be able to list your Dask clusters via `kubectl`.

```console
$ kubectl get daskclusters
No resources found in default namespace.
```

We can also check the operator pod is running:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -A -l app.kubernetes.io/name=dask-kubernetes-operator
NAMESPACE       NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dask-operator   dask-kubernetes-operator-775b8bbbd5-zdrf7   1/1     Running   0          74s
```

## Configuring a RAPIDS `DaskCluster`

To configure the `DaskCluster` resource to run RAPIDS you need to set a few things:

- The container image must contain RAPIDS, the [official RAPIDS container images](/tools/rapids-docker) are a good choice for this.
- The Dask workers must be configured with one or more NVIDIA GPU resources.
- The worker command must be set to `dask-cuda-worker`.

## Creating a RAPIDS `DaskCluster` using `kubectl`

Here is an example resource manifest for launching a RAPIDS Dask cluster with the scheduler optimization

```yaml
# rapids-dask-cluster.yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.dask.org/v1
kind: DaskCluster
metadata:
  name: rapids-dask-cluster
  labels:
    dask.org/cluster-name: rapids-dask-cluster
spec:
  worker:
    replicas: 2
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: worker
          image: "{{ rapids_container }}"
          imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
          args:
            - dask-cuda-worker
            - --name
            - $(DASK_WORKER_NAME)
          resources:
            limits:
              nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
  scheduler:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: scheduler
          image: "{{ rapids_container }}"
          imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
          env:
          args:
            - dask-scheduler
          ports:
            - name: tcp-comm
              containerPort: 8786
              protocol: TCP
            - name: http-dashboard
              containerPort: 8787
              protocol: TCP
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              port: http-dashboard
              path: /health
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              port: http-dashboard
              path: /health
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            periodSeconds: 20
          resources:
            limits:
              nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            - weight: 100
              preference:
                matchExpressions:
                  - key: dedicated
                    operator: In
                    values:
                      - scheduler
    service:
      type: ClusterIP
      selector:
        dask.org/cluster-name: rapids-dask-cluster
        dask.org/component: scheduler
      ports:
        - name: tcp-comm
          protocol: TCP
          port: 8786
          targetPort: "tcp-comm"
        - name: http-dashboard
          protocol: TCP
          port: 8787
          targetPort: "http-dashboard"
```

You can create this cluster with `kubectl`.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f rapids-dask-cluster.yaml
```

### Manifest breakdown

Most of this manifest is explained in the [Dask Operator](https://docs.rapids.ai/deployment/stable/tools/kubernetes/dask-operator/#example-using-kubecluster) documentation in the tools section of the RAPIDS documentation.

The only addition made to the example from the above documentation page is the following section in the scheduler configuration

```yaml
# ...
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: dedicated
              operator: In
              values:
                - scheduler
# ...
```

For the Dask scheduler pod we are setting a node affinity using the label previously specified on the dedicated node. Node affinity in Kubernetes allows you to constrain which nodes your Pod can be scheduled based on node labels. This is also intended to be a soft requirement as we are using the `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` type of node affinity. The Kubernetes scheduler tries to find a node which meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the Kubernetes scheduler still schedules the pod on any available node. This ensures that you will not face any issues with the Dask cluster even if the T4 node is unavailable.

### Accessing your Dask cluster

Once you have created your `DaskCluster` resource we can use `kubectl` to check the status of all the other resources it created for us.

```console
$ kubectl get all -l dask.org/cluster-name=rapids-dask-cluster
NAME                                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/rapids-dask-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-0c202b85fd   1/1     Running   0          4m13s
pod/rapids-dask-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-ff5d376714   1/1     Running   0          4m13s
pod/rapids-dask-cluster-scheduler                                1/1     Running   0          4m14s

NAME                                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
service/rapids-dask-cluster-service   ClusterIP   10.96.223.217   <none>        8786/TCP,8787/TCP   4m13s
```

Here you can see our scheduler pod and two worker pods along with the scheduler service.

If you have a Python session running within the Kubernetes cluster (like the [example one on the Kubernetes page](/platforms/kubernetes)) you should be able
to connect a Dask distributed client directly.

```python
from dask.distributed import Client

client = Client("rapids-dask-cluster-scheduler:8786")
```

Alternatively if you are outside of the Kubernetes cluster you can change the `Service` to use [`LoadBalancer`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) or [`NodePort`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport) or use `kubectl` to port forward the connection locally.

```console
$ kubectl port-forward svc/rapids-dask-cluster-service 8786:8786
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8786 -> 8786
```

```python
from dask.distributed import Client

client = Client("localhost:8786")
```

## Example using `KubeCluster`

In addition to creating clusters via `kubectl` you can also do so from Python with {class}`dask_kubernetes.operator.KubeCluster`. This class implements the Dask Cluster Manager interface and under the hood creates and manages the `DaskCluster` resource for you. You can also generate a spec with `make_cluster_spec()` which KubeCluster uses internally and then modify it with your custom options. We will use this to add node affinity to the scheduler.

```python
from dask_kubernetes.operator import KubeCluster, make_cluster_spec

spec = make_cluster_spec(
    name="rapids-dask-cluster",
    image="{{ rapids_container }}",
    n_workers=2,
    resources={"limits": {"nvidia.com/gpu": "1"}},
    worker_command="dask-cuda-worker",
)
```

To add the node affinity to the scheduler, you can create a custom dictionary specifying the type of node affinity and the label of the node.

```python
affinity_config = {
    "nodeAffinity": {
        "preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": [
            {
                "weight": 100,
                "preference": {
                    "matchExpressions": [
                        {"key": "dedicated", "operator": "In", "values": ["scheduler"]}
                    ]
                },
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Now you can add this configuration to the spec created in the previous step, and create the Dask cluster using this custom spec.

```python
spec["spec"]["scheduler"]["spec"]["affinity"] = affinity_config
cluster = KubeCluster(custom_cluster_spec=spec)
```

If we check with `kubectl` we can see the above Python generated the same `DaskCluster` resource as the `kubectl` example above.

```console
$ kubectl get daskclusters
NAME                  AGE
rapids-dask-cluster   3m28s

$ kubectl get all -l dask.org/cluster-name=rapids-dask-cluster
NAME                                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/rapids-dask-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-07d674589a   1/1     Running   0          3m30s
pod/rapids-dask-cluster-default-worker-group-worker-a55ed88265   1/1     Running   0          3m30s
pod/rapids-dask-cluster-scheduler                                1/1     Running   0          3m30s

NAME                                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
service/rapids-dask-cluster-service   ClusterIP   10.96.200.202   <none>        8786/TCP,8787/TCP   3m30s
```

With this cluster object in Python we can also connect a client to it directly without needing to know the address as Dask will discover that for us. It also automatically sets up port forwarding if you are outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

```python
from dask.distributed import Client

client = Client(cluster)
```

This object can also be used to scale the workers up and down.

```python
cluster.scale(5)
```

And to manually close the cluster.

```python
cluster.close()
```

```{note}
By default the `KubeCluster` command registers an exit hook so when the Python process exits the cluster is deleted automatically. You can disable this by setting `KubeCluster(..., shutdown_on_close=False)` when launching the cluster.

This is useful if you have a multi-stage pipeline made up of multiple Python processes and you want your Dask cluster to persist between them.

You can also connect a `KubeCluster` object to your existing cluster with `cluster = KubeCluster.from_name(name="rapids-dask")` if you wish to use the cluster or manually call `cluster.close()` in the future.
```
