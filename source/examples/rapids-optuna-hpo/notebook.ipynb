    "# Getting Started with Optuna and RAPIDS for HPO\n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) automates the process of picking values for the hyperparameters of a machine learning algorithm to improve model performance. This can help boost the model accuracy, but can be resource-intensive, as it may require training the model for hundreds of hyperparameter combinations. Let's take a look at how we can use Optuna and RAPIDS to make HPO less time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAPIDS\n",
    "The RAPIDS framework provides a suite of libraries to execute end-to-end data science pipelines entirely on GPUs. One of the libraries in this framework is cuML, which implements common machine learning models with a scikit-learn-compatible API and a GPU-accelerated backend. You can learn more about RAPIDS [here](https://rapids.ai/about.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optuna\n",
    "[Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a lightweight framework for automatic hyperparameter optimization. It provides a define-by-run API, which makes it easy to adapt to any already existing code that we have and enables high modularity along with the flexibility to construct hyperparameter spaces dynamically. By simply wrapping the objective function with Optuna, we can perform a parallel-distributed HPO search over a search space as we'll see in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management dataset from Kaggle to predict if a claim will receive accelerated approval or not. We'll explore how to use Optuna with RAPIDS in combination with Dask to run multi-GPU HPO experiments that can yield results faster than CPU."
