    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) is a suite of libraries to execute end-to-end data science pipelines entirely on GPUs. If you have data in a [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) table that you want to explore with the RAPIDS, you can deploy RAPIDS in Snowflake using Snowpark Container Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{docref} /platforms/snowflake\n",
    "For the purpose of this example, follow the Run RAPIDS on Snowflake via Snowpark Container Services on the Snowflake guide, before getting started.\n",

    "## NYC Parking Tickets `cudf.pandas` Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have data in a Snowflake table, you can accelerate your ETL workflow with `cuDF.pandas`. With `cudf.pandas` you can accelerate the `pandas` ecosystem, with zero code changes. Just load `cudf.pandas` and you will have the benefits of GPU acceleration, with automatic CPU fallback if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we have a Snowflake table with the [Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2022](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2022/7mxj-7a6y/about_data) dataset from NYC Open Data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get data into a Snowflake table\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along, you will need to have the NYC Parking Violations data into your snowflake account, and make sure that this data is accessible from the RAPIDS notebook Snowpark Service Container that you deployed following the [Run RAPIDS on Snowflake](../../platforms/snowflake) guide.\n",
