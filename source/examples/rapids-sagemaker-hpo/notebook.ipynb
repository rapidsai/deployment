    "[Hyper Parameter Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) (HPO) improves model quality by searching over hyperparameters, parameters not typically learned during the training process but rather values that control the learning process itself (e.g., model size/capacity). This search can significantly boost model quality relative to default settings and non-expert tuning; however, HPO can take a very long time on a non-accelerated platform. In this notebook, we containerize a RAPIDS workflow and run Bring-Your-Own-Container SageMaker HPO to show how we can overcome the computational complexity of model search. \n",
    "\n",
    "We accelerate HPO in two key ways: \n",
    "* by *scaling within a node* (e.g., multi-GPU where each GPU brings a magnitude higher core count relative to CPUs), and \n",
    "* by *scaling across nodes* and running parallel trials on cloud instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these two powers HPO experiments that feel unapproachable and may take multiple days on CPU instances can complete in just hours. For example, we find a <span style=\"color:#8735fb; font-size:14pt\"> **12x** </span> speedup in wall clock time (6 hours vs 3+ days) and a <span style=\"color:#8735fb; font-size:14pt\"> **4.5x** </span> reduction in cost when comparing between GPU and CPU [EC2 Spot instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-managed-spot-training.html) on 100 XGBoost HPO trials using 10 parallel workers on 10 years of the Airline Dataset (~63M flights) hosted in a S3 bucket.
