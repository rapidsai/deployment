    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Define the Objective Function, which represents the model training and evaluation process. It takes hyperparameters as inputs and returns a metric to optimize (e.g, accuracy in our case,). Refer to `train_xgboost()` and `train_randomforest()` in `hpo.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Specify the search space using the `Trial` object's methods to define the hyperparameters and their corresponding value ranges or distributions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"max_depth\": trial.suggest_int(\"max_depth\", 4, 8),\n",
    "\"max_features\": trial.suggest_float(\"max_features\", 0.1, 1.0),\n",
    "\"learning_rate\": trial.suggest_float(\"learning_rate\", 0.001, 0.1, log=True),\n",
    "\"min_samples_split\": trial.suggest_int(\"min_samples_split\", 2, 1000, log=True),\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an Optuna study object to keep track of trials and their corresponding hyperparameter configurations and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "study = optuna.create_study(\n",
    "        sampler=RandomSampler(seed=args.seed), direction=\"maximize\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select an optimization algorithm to determine how Optuna explores and exploits the search space to find optimal configurations.  For instance, the `RandomSampler` is an algorithm provided by the Optuna library that samples hyperparameter configurations randomly from the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run the Optimization by calling the Optuna's `optimize()` function on the study object. You can specify the number of trials or number of parallel jobs to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " study.optimize(lambda trial: train_xgboost(\n",
