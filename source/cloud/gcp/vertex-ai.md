# Vertex AI

RAPIDS can be deployed on [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).

## Create a new user-managed Notebook

1. From the Google Cloud UI, navigate to [**Vertex AI**](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) -> Notebook -> **Workbench**
2. Make sure you select **User-Managed Notebooks** (**Managed Notebooks** are currently not supported) and select **+ CREATE NEW**.
3. In the **Details** section give the instance a name.
4. Under the **Environment** section choose "Python 3 with CUDA 11.8".
5. Check the "Attach 1 NVIDIA T4 GPU" option.
6. After customizing any other aspects of the machine you wish, click **CREATE**.

```{tip}
If you want to select a different GPU or select other hardware options you can select "Advanced Options" at the bottom and then make changes in the "Machine type" section.
```

## Install RAPIDS

Once the instance has started select **OPEN JUPYTER LAB** and at the top of a notebook install the RAPIDS libraries you wish to use.

```bash
pip install \
    --extra-index-url={{rapids_pip_index}} \
    "cudf-cu12>={{rapids_pip_version}}" "cuml-cu12>={{rapids_pip_version}}" \
    "dask-cuda>={{rapids_pip_version}}"
```

## Test RAPIDS

You should now be able to open a notebook and use RAPIDS.

For example we could import and use RAPIDS libraries like `cudf`.

```ipython
In [1]: import cudf
In [2]: df = cudf.datasets.timeseries()
In [3]: df.head()
Out[3]:
                       id     name         x         y
