# NVIDIA Brev

The [NVIDIA Brev](https://brev.nvidia.com/) platform provides you a one stop menu of available GPU instances across many cloud providers, including [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), with CUDA, Python, Jupyter Lab, all set up.

## Brev Instance Setup

There are two options to get you up and running with RAPIDS in a few steps, thanks to the Brev RAPIDS quickstart:

1. Brev GPU Instances - quickly get the GPU, across most clouds, to get your work done.
2. Brev Launchables - quickly create one-click starting, reusable instances that you customized to your MLOps needs.

### Option 1. Setting up your Brev GPU Instance

1. Navigate to the [Brev bash](https://brev.nvidia.com/org) and click on "Create new instance".

2. Choose a compute type.

```{hint}
New users commonly choose `L4` GPUs for trying things out.
```

3. Select the button to change the container or runtime (the default is "VM Mode w/ Jupyter")

2. Select "Featured Containers".

3. Attach the "NVIDIA RAPIDS" Container and choose "Apply".

5. Give your instance a name and hit "Deploy".

### Option 2. Setting up your Brev Launchable

Brev Launchables are shareable environment configurations that combine code, containers, and compute into a single
portable recipe. This option is most applicable if you want to set up a custom environment for a blueprint, like
our [Single-cell Analysis Blueprint](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/single-cell-analysis-blueprint/).
However, you can use this to create quick-start templates for many different kinds of projects when you want users to
drop into an environment that is ready to go (e.g. tutorials, workshops, demos, etc.).

You can read more about Brev Launchables in the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/brev/latest/launchables-getting-started.html).

1. Go to [Brevâ€™s Launchable Creator](https://brev.nvidia.com/launchables/create) (requires account)
2. When asked **How would you like to provide your code files?**.
   - Select "I have code files in a git repository", and provide the link to a github repository, if you have one that you'd like
     to be mounted in the instance once is up.
   - Otherwise, select "I don't have any code files".
3. When asked **What type of runtime environment do you need?** select "With container(s)", and proceed.

4. When prompted to **Choose a Container Configuration**, you have two options:
   1. **"Featured Container"** and select the "NVIDIA RAPIDS" container: For a ready to go environment with the
      entire RAPIDS stack and Jupyter configured.
      - Select your desired compute environment. Make sure you select sufficient disk size to download the datasets you
        want to work with. Note, you will not be able to resize the instance once created.
      - Create a name for your launchable, and deploy.
   2. **Docker Compose**: For a custom container that you can tailor to your needs.
      - You can provide a `docker-compose.yaml` via url o from a local file. The structure should be as follow

      ```yaml
      services:
      backend:
         image: "{{rapids_notebooks_container}}"
         pull_policy: always
         ulimits:
            memlock: -1
            stack: 67108864
         shm_size: 1g
         deploy:
            resources:
            reservations:
               devices:
                  - driver: nvidia
                  count: all
                  capabilities: [gpu]
         environment:
            EXTRA_CONDA_PACKAGES: "hdbscan>=0.8.39 umap-learn>=0.5.7" # example of packages
         ports:
            - "8888:8888"      # Expose JupyterLab
         volumes:
            - /home/ubuntu/<name_of_your_github_repo>:/notebooks/ # e.g tutorial if repo at https://github.com/rapidsai-community/tutorial
         user: root
         working_dir: /notebooks
         entrypoint: ["/home/rapids/entrypoint.sh"]
         command: python -m jupyter lab --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' --notebook-dir=/notebooks
         restart: unless-stopped
      ```

      - Click "Validate".
      - Select your desired compute environment. Make sure you select sufficient disk size to download the datasets you
        want to work with. Note, you will not be able to resize the instance once created.
      - On the next page, when asked **Do you want a Jupyter Notebook experience?** select **No, I don't want Jupyter**. This
        is because the RAPIDS notebook container already have Jupyter setup. For convenience name the Secure Link to jupyter.

      ![Screenshot showing the Brev launchable Jupyter experience setup](/_static/images/platforms/brev/brev-launchable-jupyter-setup-docker-compose.png)
      - Create a name for your launchable, and deploy.

## Accessing your instance

There are a few ways to access your instance:

1. Directly access Jupyter Lab from the Brev GUI
1. Using the Brev CLI to connect to your instance....
1. Using Visual Studio Code
1. Using SSH via your terminal
1. Access using the Brev tunnel
1. Sharing a service with others

### 1. Jupyter Notebook

To create and use a Jupyter Notebook, click "Open Notebook" at the top right after the page has deployed.

![Screenshot of the instance UI with the "Open Notebook" button highlighted](/_static/images/platforms/brev/brev8.png)

### 2. Brev CLI Install

If you want to access your launched Brev instance(s) via Visual Studio Code or SSH using terminal, you need to install the [Brev CLI according to these instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/brev/latest/brev-cli.html) or this code below:

```bash
$ sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brevdev/brev-cli/main/bin/install-latest.sh)" && brev login
```

#### 2.1 Brev CLI using Visual Studio Code

To connect to your Brev instance from VS Code open a new VS Code window and run:

```bash
$ brev open <instance-id>
```

It will automatically open a new VS Code window for you to use with RAPIDS.

#### 2.2 Brev CLI using SSH via your Terminal

To access your Brev instance from the terminal run:

```bash
$ brev shell <instance-id>
```

##### Forwarding a Port Locally

Assuming your Jupyter Notebook is running on port `8888` in your Brev environment, you can forward this port to your local machine using the following SSH command:

```bash
$ ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 <username>@<ip> -p 22
```

This command forwards port `8888` on your local machine to port `8888` on the remote Brev environment.

Or for port `2222` (default port).

```bash
$ ssh <username>@<ip> -p 2222
```

Replace `username` with your username and `ip` with the ip listed if it's different.

##### Accessing the Service

After running the command, open your web browser and navigate to your local host. You will be able to access the Jupyter Notebook running in your Brev environment as if it were running locally.

#### 3. Access the Jupyter Notebook via the Tunnel

The "Deployments" section will show that your Jupyter Notebook is running on port `8888`, and it is accessible via a shareable URL Ex: `jupyter0-i55ymhsr8.brevlab.com`.

Click on the link or copy and paste the URL into your web browser's address bar to access the Jupyter Notebook interface directly.

##### 4. Share the Service

If you want to share access to this service with others, you can click on the "Share a Service" button.

You can also manage access by clicking "Edit Access" to control who has the ability to use this service.

### Check that your notebook has GPU Capabilities

You can verify that you have your requested GPU by running the `nvidia-smi` command.

![Screenshot of a notebook terminal running the command nvidia-smi and showing the NVIDIA T4 GPU in the output](/_static/images/platforms/brev/brev6.png)

## Testing your RAPIDS Instance

You can verify your RAPIDS installation is working by importing `cudf` and creating a GPU dataframe.

```python
import cudf

gdf = cudf.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5, 6]})
print(gdf)
```

## Resources and tips

- [Brev Docs](https://brev.dev/)
- Please note: Git is not preinstalled in the RAPIDS container, but can be installed into the container when it is running using

```bash
$ apt update
```

```bash
$ apt install git -y
```
